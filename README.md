This is an [sbt](http://scala-sbt.org/) plugin for code coverage analysis via [JaCoCo](http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/).

Install the plugin by adding the following to `project/plugins.sbt`:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("org.scala-sbt" % "sbt-jacoco" % "3.0.0")
```

And then execute the plugin with `sbt jacoco`. This will instrument and run the unit tests and output the coverage
metrics:

```
[info] ------- Jacoco Coverage Report --------

[info] Check /home/example/jacoco-test/target/scala-2.11/jacoco/report for detailed report

A detailed HTML report will also be generated in the directory shown that includes line level details of coverage.
